# B is a block, which includes a list of transactions, see section 4.3

# the block-level state-transition function (called "state-accumulation function" in section 4.3.2)

# 3. Conventions #
##################

# lowercase Greek letters are state values
# sigma is the world state
# mu is the machine state

# uppercase Greek letters are functions which operate on the state
# e.g. Upsilon is the Ethereum STF

# keccak-256
def KEC(bytes_):
  return crypto.keccak256(bytes_)

# keccak-512
def KEC512(bytes_):
  return crypto.keccak512(bytes_)

# uppercase letters are functions or tuples
# e.g. C is the cost function
# e.g. T is a transaction
# can be subscripted
#   with uppercase subscript is component of tuple e.g. C_SSTORE
#   with component e.g. T.n is nonce of tx

# lowercase letters denote scalars and byte arrays (bold in yellowpaper)
# e.g. n is nonce
# e.g. greek delta is number of items required on stack for a give operation
# e.g. o is byte array output by a message call

# bold uppercase can be used for important values

# $\mathbb{N}$ is non-negative integers
# $\mathbb{B}$ is all byte sequences, see appx B
# $\mathbb{B}_{32}$ is all byte sequences of length 32
# $\mathbb{N}_{256}$ is non-negative integers less than 2^256, see section 4.3

# square brackets index components or subsequences of a sequence
# e.g. mu.s[0] is top of stack
# ellipses specify a range
# e.g. mu_m[0..31] is first 32 items of memory

# state sigma is sequence of accounts, use square brackets to access account by address

# if value takes intermediate values, first value is <blah>, modified value is <blah>', intermediate values are <blah>*, <blah>**, ..., <blah>'
# may also use alpha-numeric subscripts to denote intermediate values

# given function f, f* is f over a sequence, element-wise, see section 4.3

# last item of a sequence
def l(x):
  return x[len(x)-1]

# 4.1 World State

# sigma (i.e. greek letter "𝛔") is the world state, maps storage tree addresses/keys to their Account/leaf instance
# world state is usually implemented with a "state database" of key-value pairs of hashes to their values
# we define our state tree as a dict: address or key -> leaf value, and as a root node as described in appx D
# The state tree includes the underlying tree, accessed through root_node, see appx D for how we implement the tree nodes

    # a shallow copy of state leafs, but reuses existing memoized_tree
